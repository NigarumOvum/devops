#First, upgrade kubeadm on the Control Plane Node
#Replace the version with the version you want to upgrade to.

#Run upgrade plan to test the upgrade process and run pre-flight checks
#Highlights additional work needed after the upgrade, such as manually updating the kubelets
#And displays version information for the control plan components

#Run the upgrade, you can get this from the previous output.
#Runs preflight checks - API available, Node status Ready and control plane healthy
#Checks to ensure you're upgrading along the correct upgrade path
#Prepulls container images to reduce downtime of control plane components
#For each control plane component, 
#   Updates the certificates used for authentication
#   Creates a new static pod manifest in /etc/kubernetes/mainifests and saves the old one to /etc/kubernetes/tmp
#   Which causes the kubelet to restart the pods
#Updates the Control Plane Node's kubelet configuration and also updates CoreDNS and kube-proxy
sudo kubeadm upgrade apply v1.26.1  #<---this format is different than the package's version format


#Look for [upgrade/successful] SUCCESS! Your cluster was upgraded to "v1.xx.yy". Enjoy!
