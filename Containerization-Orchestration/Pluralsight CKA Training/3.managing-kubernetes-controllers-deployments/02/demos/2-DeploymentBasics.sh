#Demo 2 Creating a Deployment Imperatively, with kubectl create,
#you have lot's of options available to you such as image, container ports, and replicas
kubectl create deployment hello-world --image=psk8s.azurecr.io/hello-app:1.0
kubectl scale deployment hello-world --replicas=5


#These two commands can be combined into one command if needed
#kubectl create deployment hello-world --image=psk8s.azurecr.io/hello-app:1.0 --replicas=5


#Check out the status of our imperative deployment
kubectl get deployment 


#Now let's delete that and move towards declarative configuration.
kubectl delete deployment hello-world




#Demo 1.b - Declaratively
#Simple Deployment
#Let's start off declaratively creating a deployment with a service.
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml


#Check out the status of our deployment, which creates the ReplicaSet, which creates our Pods
kubectl get deployments hello-world


#The first replica set created in our deployment, which has the responsibility of keeping
#of maintaining the desired state of our application but starting and keeping 5 pods online. 
#In the name of the replica set is the pod-template-hash
kubectl get replicasets


#The actual pods as part of this replicaset, we know these pods belong to the replicaset because of the
#pod-template-hash in the name
kubectl get pods


#But also by looking at the 'Controlled By' property
kubectl describe pods | head -n 20


#It's the job of the deployment-controller to maintain state. Let's look at it a litte closer
#The selector defines which pods are a member of this deployment.
#Replicas define the current state of the deployment, we'll dive into what each one of these means later in the course.
#In Events, you can see the creation and scaling of the replica set to 5
kubectl describe deployment


#Remove our resources
kubectl delete deployment hello-world
kubectl delete service hello-world
