#API Discovery
#Get information about our current cluster context, ensure we're logged into the correct cluster.
kubectl config get-contexts


#Change our context if needed by specifying the Name
kubectl config use-context kubernetes-admin@kubernetes


#Get information about the API Server for our current context, which should be kubernetes-admin@kubernetes
kubectl cluster-info


#Get a list of API Resources available in the cluster
kubectl api-resources | more


#Using kubectl explain to see the structure of a resource...specifically it's fields
#In addition to using the API reference on the web this is a great way to discover what it takes to write yaml manifests
kubectl explain pods | more


#Let's look more closely at what we need in pod.spec and pod.spec.containers (image and name are required)
kubectl explain pod.spec | more
kubectl explain pod.spec.containers | more


#Let's check out some YAML and creating a pod with YAML
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml


#Get a list of our currently running pods
kubectl get pods


#Remove our pod...this command blocks and can take a second to complete
kubectl delete pod hello-world




#Working with kubectl dry-run
#Use kubectl dry-run for server side validatation of a manifest...the object will be sent to the API Server.
#dry-run=server will tell you the object was created...but it wasn't...
#it just goes through the whole process but didn't get stored in etcd.
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml --dry-run=server


#No deployment is created
kubectl get deployments


#Use kubectl dry-run for client side validatation of a manifest...
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml --dry-run=client


#Let's do that one more time but with an error...replica should be replicas.
kubectl apply -f deployment-error.yaml --dry-run=client


#Use kubectl dry-run client to generate some yaml...for an object
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client


#Combine dry-run client with -o yaml and you'll get the YAML for the object...in this case a deployment
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml | more


#Can be any object...let's try a pod...
kubectl run pod nginx-pod --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml | more


#We can combine that with IO redirection and store the YAML into a file
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml > deployment-generated.yaml
more deployment-generated.yaml


#And then we can deploy from that manifest...or use it as a building block for more complex manfiests
kubectl apply -f deployment-generated.yaml


#Clean up from that demo...you can use delete with -f to delete all the resources in the manifests
kubectl delete -f deployment-generated.yaml




#Working with kubectl diff
#Create a deployment with 4 replicas
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml


#Diff that with a deployment with 5 replicas and a new container image...you will see other metadata about the object output too.
kubectl diff -f deployment-new.yaml | more


#Clean up from this demo...you can use delete with -f to delete all the resources in the manifests
kubectl delete -f deployment.yaml
