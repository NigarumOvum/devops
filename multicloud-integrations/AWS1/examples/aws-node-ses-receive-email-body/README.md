# Receive an email, store in S3 bucket, trigger a lambda function

This example shows how to receive an email with SES, store the email including the body on S3 and have S3
trigger a lambda function.

## Use-cases

- Postprocess of email body.

## Setup

- [Create a SES verified Domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/receiving-email-getting-started-verify.html) but do not setup the "Rule Set"
- Edit `serverless.yml` and choose a unique S3 bucket name but follow the [normalizing Rules](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/resources#aws-cloudformation-resource-reference) to allow to use the name for the `bucketRef`. To keep it working use a name which  contains only the characters a-z. The `bucketRef` is the constant string `S3Bucket` plus the `bucket` name with the first letter uppercase.
- if you change the region check if SES receiving exists in your region

## Deploy

In order to deploy the example, simply run:

```bash
serverless deploy
```

The output should look similar to:

```

## Setup SNS Email Receiving Rule

1) Open the Amazon SES console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ses/
2) In the navigation pane, under Email Receiving, choose Rule Sets.
3) Choose **Create a Receipt Rule**.
4) On the Recipients page, choose **Next Step**. (Without a adding any recipients, Amazon SES applies this rule to all recipients)
5) For **Add action**, choose **S3**.
6) For **S3 bucket**,choose **Enter a bucket name** and select the bucket with the name you defined in `serverless.yml`
7) Choose **Next Step**
8) On the **Rule Details** page, for **Rule name**, type **my-rule**. Select the check box next to **Enabled**, and then choose **Next Step**.
9) On the **Review** page, choose **Create Rule**.


## Usage

Send a test email to the receipient.

You should see a new S3 object in the bucket which contains the whole email body.

After a while, the postprocess function gets triggerd by an S3 event:

```bash
serverless logs --function postprocess
```
